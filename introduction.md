# Introducing 3EN's Engineering Code of Conduct

At 3EN we want to Engage, Enable and Enhance our Customers, but we also want to do the same for our employees. The engineering team decided that a code of conduct would be a worthwhile exercise and agreed that we should have a look at other companies examples. We forked this repo from the [DigitalOcean Engineering Team](http://digitalocean.github.io/engineering-code-of-conduct/) and will make changes over time to best suit our company
